Hopefully, you are reading "ku-thesis.pdf". If you are reading a file with some other name, then there's been a goof up. This document is produced by the LaTeX compiler "pdflatex". The file collection needed to reproduce this document is named "KU-thesis-20170413.zip" (the date changes from time to time, of course). The Web home for this project is https://crmda.ku.edu/latex. Previous versions have been offered at http://pj.freefaculty.org/guides/Computing-HOWTO/KU-thesis. That site will always point at the newest edition and there should also be a copy in the Electronic Thesis Webpages pages hosted by the office of the Graduate Dean.

You will love using LaTeX to prepare your thesis. The power to keep content structured, with a systematic framework for cross references among figures, tables, equations, and sections, will significantly improve your quality of life. This will be much better than using an ordinary "text editor."

Well, that's all well and good. But what is this? There are three kinds of files.
